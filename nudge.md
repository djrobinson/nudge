Introduction

Blockchain technology has inspired a generation of technologists to create one of the most unique and prolific ecosystems of tools in recent history. The nature of these organizations is truly different from things we have seen before, sharing much of their structure from the open-source software projects that they stemmed from. The blockchain industry's open source roots has led to organizations composed of people working on ideas with a wildly diverse backgrounds, interests, geographies, and physical characteristics. This has led to a explosion of innovation, with each tool in the space introducing inventions that simply couldn't have been thought of before without the concepts introduced by distributed ledger tech. The promise from the industry is massive and the momentum carrying this innovation is exponentially larger than the force that drove their open-source predecessors to such importance in the world. Some of this increased interest can be explained by the promise of the technology alone, but for anyone who has read a headline about the space it's clear that what is driving the industry is not plain altruism. It is the introduction of blockchain's unique funding mechanism, the cryptocurrency, that enabled the massive funding which launched these open-source projects from the obscurity of internet message boards to the top stories of international news outlets. The surge in innovation has, since the early days of bitcion, has been counteracted by a hunger for power and overwhilming greed that could destroy the ethos on which this technology was founded. The promises of decentralization, egaltarianism, and more effective markets and democracies have been drown out by in-fighting and bickering which has led the world to the conclusion that the industry cannot live up to it's own ethos of and will not be able to stand on its own. Promising the world innovative governance and more efficient markets and then delivering some of the most embarrassing displays of organizational and financial management is detestable. In its present state the blockchain industry is an messy grouping of individuals who cannot practice what they preach, and it is in the process of being captured by those who have "proven" that they can run markets and organizations. Blockchains might be repurposed into special purpose databases that give minor security improvements for large companies that provide

In order to understand how we can innovate our way out of capture, it is important to understand
